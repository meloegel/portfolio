My experience at Lambda school has not only given me leadership and problem solving skills but also the confidence and ability to be  able to teach myself. It is something I will use the rest of my life in the pursuit to gain knowledge in the ever changing industry. I am currently based near Detroit Michigan (Madison Heights) and I am excited to potentially work with you! </h3>
