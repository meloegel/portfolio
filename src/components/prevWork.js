                    <h4>Construction Manager</h4>
                    <h4>Collaborative Advantage Marketing - Detroit MI 2019</h4>
                    <p> In 2019, I took over the construction project in the building. The project was to add 4 more floors to the building that would be built into residences. Daily I would manage trades, give them tasks for the day, answer any questions and order supplies. I would direct work for anywhere from 8-15 laborers for the day as well as monitor and evaluate progress. Once the first additional floor was added, residents then moved in (11 total) and I assisted with the move, met any construction/ IT or general building needs. I ended my employment at CAM mid-July 2019.</p>
