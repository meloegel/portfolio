                    <p className="text-white m-auto w-11/12"> In 2019, I took over the construction project in the building. The project was to add 4 more floors to the building that would be built into residences. Daily I would manage t
                    es, give them tasks for the day, answer any questions and order supplies. I would direct work for anywhere from 8-15 laborers for the day as well as monitor and evaluate progress. Once the first additional floor was added, residents then moved in (11 total) and I assisted with the move, met any construction/ IT or general building needs. I ended my employment at CAM mid-July 2019.</p>
